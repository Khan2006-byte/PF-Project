# Project Title: Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis. The workflow includes data creation, exploration, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, visualization, and final export. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from a dataset and present the findings in a structured manner.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Clone this repository and follow the instructions below to execute the notebook.

## Features
- **Data Creation:** Synthesizing or importing raw data for analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and identify key patterns.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Data Manipulation:** Structuring data for further analysis.
- **Data Selection:** Filtering relevant data for specific use cases.
- **Data Analysis:** Applying statistical methods and calculations to derive insights.
- **Visualization:** Representing data graphically to highlight trends and findings.
- **Final Export:** Exporting processed data or results.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`

Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`final project pf.ipynb`).
2. Follow the step-by-step sections to:
   - Explore and clean the dataset.
   - Perform data manipulation and selection.
   - Analyze and visualize the data.
3. Export the final processed data or results.

## Results
- Key columns include Customer ID, Category, Item, Quantity, Price Per Unit, and more.
- Some columns have missing values, which are addressed during the cleaning process.

Example output:
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 1000 entries, 0 to 999
Data columns (total 9 columns):
 #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------            --------------  -----  
 0   Customer ID       918 non-null    object 
 1   Category          914 non-null    object 
 2   Item              897 non-null    object 
 3   Quantity          895 non-null    float64
 4   Price Per Unit    913 non-null    float64
 5   Total Spent       896 non-null    float64
 6   Payment Method    898 non-null    object 
 7   Location          902 non-null    object 
 8   Transaction Date  907 non-null    object 
dtypes: float64(3), object(6)
memory usage: 70.4+ KB
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for data analysis, starting from raw data to meaningful insights and exportable results. It provides a structured approach for handling datasets, making it a valuable resource for analysts and data enthusiasts.
